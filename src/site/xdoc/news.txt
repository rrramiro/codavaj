################# 1.0.0 ###################
Proudly presenting the first released version of codavaj ( javadoc in reverse ).
A seemingly useless reverse engineering tool to transform HTML javadoc into java source file skeletons,
or a reflection api-like internal representation.

Codavaj attempts to acertain all aspects of a Class's ( or Interface's ) structure - methods, constructors, fields,
modifiers, inheritance heirarchy, constant field values etc - through analyzing an entire Javadoc
tree.

The initial version provides a utility to download an entire javadoc tree from a remote (http://) location.
Furthermore a utility to transform the javadoc tree into a java source tree.

################# 1.1.0 ###################
Codavaj ( 1.1.0 ) released

Codavaj is a seemingly useless reverse engineering tool to transform HTML javadoc into 
java source file skeletons, or a reflection api-like internal representation.

New features include
- the ability to resolve Class names to externally linked javadocs.
  Links to Sun's reference apis are resolved automatically  ( i.e. http://java.sun.com/j2se/X/docs/api/ ).
  Any other external links will need to be given as extra parameters for the codavaj command.
and
- significant extentions to the reflection-like API to represent Packages
  and link Types to their respective Packages and back, and also represent
  package heirarchy.

################# 1.2.0 ###################
Codavaj ( 1.2.0 ) released

Codavaj is a seemingly useless reverse engineering tool to transform HTML javadoc into

New features include
- the ability to parse javadocs generated by the 1.5 javadoc tool.
  - known limitations: enums and generics constructs not supported yet.
- several minor bug fixes parsing constant values like "NaN", "0d/0d" etc.
- linux/unix like command line tool


################# 1.3.0 ###################
